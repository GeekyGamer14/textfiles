# What is HS Bronies?
#### For TDH Advocate.

[HS Bronies](http://facebook.com/groups/HSBronies) is a spin-off of the Facebook group [HS Hackers](http://facebook.com/groups/PennAppsHS).

It was created at a HS Hackers meetup by one of the members there. This meetup was serious. Very serious. Yeah.

Anyways, um...
